The package focuses on the design and fabrication of timber joinery. It is built on top of the COMPAS framework and offers a suite of tools for designing and fabricating timber structures. The project facilitates the detection of interfaces between elements and enables the creation of joinery connections among them. The workflow was refined through insights from several researchers, the 5-axis CNC machining process, and the transfer of academic research to practical construction projects, providing a valuable learning experience. Numerous case studies often exhibited similar workflows, which led to the development of single-case-study code-developments that evolved into a structured and performative package. This package was initiated in 2017 as part of Petras Vestartas's PhD thesis, "Design-to-Fabrication Workflow for Raw-Sawn-Timber using Joinery Solver" (`DOI <https://doi.org/10.5075/epfl-thesis-8928>`_).
