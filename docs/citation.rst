    DEVELOPER:
    Petras Vestartas, petasvestartas@gmail.com
    Funding: EPFL and NCCR Digital Fabrication 
    
    HISTORY:
    1) The first version was written during the PhD 8928 thesis of Petras Vestartas called:
        Design-to-Fabrication Workflow for Raw-Sawn-Timber using Joinery Solver, 2017-2021
    2) The translation from C# to C++ was started during the funding of NCCR in two steps
        A - standalone C++ version of the joinery solver and B - integration to COMPAS framework (Python Pybind11)
    3) Pacakge was rewritten to be compatible with COMPAS2 framework and easier C++ integration via Nanobind.
